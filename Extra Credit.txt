ExtraCredit- Deployment


->Create an RDS instance in AWS.
->Choose the database engine based on your preference (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
->Set up security groups to allow access from the web server and scheduled task.
->Once the database is up, create the tables using the schema defined in problem 1.

Web Server:
->Create an EC2 instance and install the necessary dependencies for running the web framework we chose in problem 4 (e.g., Flask).
->Install and configure the web server software (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to act as a reverse proxy for your web application.
->Configure the web server to use HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates.
->Set up the security groups to allow incoming traffic on port 80 and 443.
->Once the server is up, deploy your web application to it.

Scheduled Ingestion:
->Create a Lambda function that will run the ingestion code you wrote in problem 2 on a schedule.
->Configure the function to use the same security group as the database to allow it to connect to the database.
->Set up the function to run on a schedule (e.g., every day at midnight).
->Once the function is created, test it to ensure it runs as expected.

Load Balancing and Auto Scaling:
->Create an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple web server instances. This will improve availability and scalability of your application.
->Set up an Auto Scaling group to automatically launch additional web server instances when traffic increases and remove them when traffic decreases.

Monitoring and Logging:
->Set up CloudWatch to monitor your infrastructure and generate alarms when there are issues.
->Set up CloudTrail to log all API calls made to your application.
->Set up centralized logging using services like CloudWatch Logs or Elasticsearch to collect and analyze logs from your application and infrastructure.

This is just one possible approach to deploying the application on AWS. The exact details will depend on your specific use case and requirements
